Why we need enumerations
    Day make for clearer and more readable code,
    particularly when meaningful names are used.
    The benefits of using enumerations include:
        Reduces errors caused by transposing or mistyping numbers.
        Makes it easy to change values in the future.


Intro to enumerations or enum types
    An Enum is a language construct that is used to defined type-safe enumerations or
    variables (Variables of enum types)
    Enums are:
         By default constant so we can not change them.
         Enumeration means a list of named constant.
    In Java, enumeration defines a class type.
    An Enumeration can have constructors, methods and instance variables.
    It is created using enum keyword.
